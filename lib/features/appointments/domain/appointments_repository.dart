/// routes over the shared `appointment-commands.ts`, never as a generic
/// `updateStatus(status)` call that could duplicate that dispatch client
/// side. `PATCH /appointments/[id]` is NOT separately exposed here — for
/// CONFIRMED/REJECTED/NO_SHOW it is the exact same server-side command as
/// the named routes, and CANCELLED (the one transition without a named
/// route) is reached through [cancel].
