/// Standalone first-class Vehicles list screen — P3-F3.
///
/// **Scope note for the follow-up migration:** this slice does not touch
/// `lib/features/shell/presentation/screens/search_screen.dart` — that file
/// is exclusively owned by the concurrent `P3-F2` (customer list) worker to
/// avoid a collision, and the slice text's "vehicle tab of `search_screen`"
/// line is deliberately not implemented here. The follow-up task that
/// migrates that tab should:
///
/// 1. Construct a [VehicleListController] (optionally sharing one
///    `VehiclesRepository` instance with anything else on that screen) and
///    provide it with `ChangeNotifierProvider`, exactly as this screen does.
/// 2. Embed [VehicleListView] as the tab's body instead of rebuilding list
///    UI — it already owns the search field, pagination, and the
///    empty/error/race-safe states this slice's tests cover. The
///    `assigned`/`postpaid` filters are this screen's app-bar sheet, not
///    part of the view.
/// 3. Call `controller.loadVehicles()` once, on first build (see
///    `_VehicleListScreenState.didChangeDependencies` below) — not in
///    `initState`, so it does not fire before the widget tree can show a
///    loading state.
/// 4. Replace the legacy tab's hand-rolled debounce and any direct
///    `DiagnosticService` call, matching what `P3-F2` does for the customer
///    tab — this slice's controller already owns the only debounce needed.
/// 5. Wire [onTap] to the vehicle detail route once it exists
///    (`P3-F5`/`P3-F6`); until then this screen's own [onTap] is a no-op,
///    deliberately, rather than reaching into the legacy
///    `VehicleDetailScreen` which takes the incompatible legacy
///    `VehicleSummary` model, not this slice's `Vehicle` domain model.
