/// impossible to construct, not a runtime 400. `limit` is the legacy alias of
/// `pageSize` and is deliberately not exposed — sending both would be
/// ambiguous.

/// One frozen repository contract for the Vehicles feature — P3-F1.

/// One named method per backend route, exactly as

/// "update field" call: the backend's `updateVehicleCommand` is a single
/// whole-record command with its own validation, plate immutability and
/// owner-change blocking, and splitting it client-side would duplicate that
/// dispatch.
///
/// Errors a caller must expect and cannot prevent locally, all surfaced as
/// `Err(AppError)` with `statusCode`/`code`/`fieldErrors` preserved by the
/// shared `mapDioException`:
/// * `403` — the list and detail reads require `vehicles.view`;
///   create/update/HUR-refresh require `vehicles.create`/`vehicles.edit`;
///   delete requires `vehicles.delete`.
/// * `404` — a vehicle with no `TenantVehicle` link for this tenant is
///   indistinguishable from one that does not exist. Never treat a 404 as
///   proof the row is gone globally.
/// * `422 PLAN_LIMIT_REACHED` — `MAX_VEHICLES` is enforced on **every** entry
///   point (D-154 supersedes D-151), so [createVehicle] can fail for a reason
///   no form validation can predict.
/// * `422 VALIDATION_FAILED` — carries `fieldErrors` keyed by `plate`,
///   `make`, `model`, `year`, `mileage`, `capacity`, `wheelPosition`,
///   `customerId`.
/// * `422 VEHICLE_OWNER_CHANGE_BLOCKED` — [updateVehicle] cannot move a
///   vehicle with service history to another owner.
/// * `409 VEHICLE_IN_USE` — [deleteVehicle] against a vehicle with orders or
///   diagnostic reports.
/// * `502` — [refreshFromHur] upstream failure. Expected, not a crash path;
///   nothing was written.
